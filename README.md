About the Project
NextTweet is an early-stage clone of Twitter, built using Next.js and Vercel. The project is still under development, with additional features such as follows and likes planned for future releases.
This project aims to revolutionize the way users interact with and consume news and information from around the world. Our platform is designed to deliver a superior quality of service with significantly faster access to news and updates, similar to the functionalities previously seen on platforms like Twitter.


The project is hosted on GitHub Pages, leveraging the capabilities of a GitHub repository to share and showcase the project with a broader audience. By using GitHub Pages, we ensure that the NextTweet project is easily accessible, version-controlled, and publicly available for collaboration and feedback. This hosting solution not only provides a convenient platform for deployment but also integrates seamlessly with our development workflow, allowing us to continuously improve and update the project in a transparent and efficient manner.


Demo Link
This section will be updated with the link to the live demo.

# Getting started
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/NextTweet.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd NextTweet
    ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4. **Create a `.env` file:**
    - Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the necessary environment variables.
    - If you want to set up the database on Vercel, you can automatically create the tweets, users, and followings tables by running the initialization script: **node init-db.js**  
5. **Start the project:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
This will launch the application on http://localhost:3000 or the next available port. Navigate to the URL in your browser to start using the application.



# Key features of our application include:

**Social Interactions:** Users can engage with the content and with each other through likes, follows, and retweets, enhancing the social experience.

**User-Friendly Interface:** We've designed a clean, intuitive interface that makes navigation and interaction seamless and straightforward for users of all tech levels.

**Continuous Improvement:** The project is built with scalability in mind, allowing for ongoing enhancements and the addition of new features based on user feedback and technological advancements.

By focusing on these aspects, we strive to create a dynamic and engaging environment that keeps users informed and connected, no matter where they are.


# Technologies

  - We use SCSS for styling the project. SCSS allows nesting of classes within other classes, making the CSS more modular and easier to maintain.
  
- **Next.js:**
  - Next.js is a powerful React framework that supports server-side rendering and static site generation, enhancing the performance and SEO of the application.

- **Vercel:**
  - Vercel is used for hosting and as the database for our project. It offers seamless deployment and scalability, making it an excellent choice for modern web applications.

- **PostgreSQL:**
  - PostgreSQL is used as the relational database management system for our project. It provides robust data integrity, advanced features, and support for complex queries, making it 
    ideal for handling our application's data.

# Database Authentication

Database authentication details for Postgres are stored in the `.env` file. When setting up a new database on Vercel, you can use the `unitDB` file to create the necessary tables.

'''javascript
const Pool = new Pool({
    connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
});

DATABASE: (tutaj screenshot z Vercela)
